# PAIG - Prolog Agent In a Grid
Artificial Intelligence homework

A grid of any shape is explored by an agent. The cells in the grid can be
- objects (cell contains an object)
- obstacle
- empty
- wormhole (teleports the agent to the wormhole's corresponding end - another cell in the grid)
- ice (makes the agent mantain his initial movement in that cell too)
The agent can see one cell up, down, left or right and at each moment of time, he can move only one cell in any free direction
The program makes the agent explore the grid to find X objects and return them to his initial position.
